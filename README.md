# JMeter Custom Metrics and Tags for InfluxDB 2.xx
JMeter's default listeners often fail to capture the specific metrics needed for projects. To address this, we can create custom Listeners to send data to InfluxDB 2.xx. Using a JSR223 Listener, we can implement various types of custom metrics, ensuring project requirements are effectively met and enhancing data collection and analysis in JMeter.

# Overview
This project enhances JMeter's capabilities to capture and analyze custom performance metrics by leveraging Backend Listeners and JSR223 Listeners to send data to InfluxDB 2.xx. By implementing custom tags and metrics, users can tailor their performance testing data to meet specific project requirements, allowing for more effective analysis and insights.

# Benefits
**Enhanced Data Collection**
1. Custom Metrics: Capture specific performance metrics relevant to your project, such as thread group names along with active threads in specifc thread groups, response times, error rates, throughput etc.
2. Contextual Insights: Use custom tags to provide context (e.g., user IDs, transaction types) for your metrics, enabling richer data analysis.

# Improved Data Analysis
1. Filtering and Aggregation: Custom tags allow for efficient filtering and aggregation of data within InfluxDB, making it easier to identify trends and issues.
2. Granular Insights: Analyze performance data at a more granular level, helping teams quickly pinpoint performance bottlenecks and optimize application behavior.

# Flexibility and Customization
1. Tailored Solutions: Modify Backend and JSR223 Listeners to fit the unique needs of your project, ensuring that the metrics collected are both relevant and actionable.
2. Dynamic Metrics: Dynamically create and send metrics based on runtime conditions or user-defined variables, allowing for real-time monitoring and adjustments.

# JSR223 Listeners
Use Groovy scripts to capture and send custom metrics with associated tags.
Capture data like response times, track threads groups users, and send it to InfluxDB for further analysis.
