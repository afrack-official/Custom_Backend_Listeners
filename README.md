# Custom_Backend_Listeners
JMeter's default listeners often fail to capture the specific metrics needed for projects. To address this, we can create custom Listeners to send data to InfluxDB 2.xx. Using a JSR223 Listener, we can implement various types of custom metrics, ensuring project requirements are effectively met and enhancing data collection and analysis in JMeter.
